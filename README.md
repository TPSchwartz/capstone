# TENNESSEE CLIMBS: A guide to the greatest outdoor routes in the state
> Tennessee is one of the best states in the Southeast United States for outdoor rock climbing. Among the sandstone cliffs and boulders along the Cumberland Plateau, climbers have no shortage of quality routes to choose from. But how do climbers themselves feel about Tennessee routes, and what are the factors that cause them to rate a climb highly or poorly?

## General information
- This project was created with data from Mountain Project and OpenBeta.io in order to explore information about rock climbing routes in TN.
- I have been rock climbing for a few years now, so this is a project that I was personally very excited to explore.
- There is a lot of very interesting information here about geographical location of routes, user ratings, types of routes, etc.


## Technologies used
- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Tableau
- Microsoft Excel

## Features
- By hovering over the area markers on the map, you can see a tooltip that shows information about every route in that area.
- By selecting a specific route in the recommender at the bottom of the dashboard, you can see additional recommended routes based on user ratings.


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by OpenBeta and several projects that the community there has created.
- The route recommender was based on this guide by Viet Nguyen. - https://openbeta.substack.com/p/building-a-climbing-route-recommendation?s=r
